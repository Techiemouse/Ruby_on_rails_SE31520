Car Insurance System - SE31520 09/12/2013
-------------------------------

GENERAL USAGE NOTES
---------------------

1. Start the Rails Server by using the command line. Navigate to the path of the Online_insurance_underwriter folder and type: bundle exec ruby bin/secure_rails s

This will allow access to the Rails View by going to https://localhost:3002
Using SQLite Manager in the Mozilla Firefox can give you access to the database. 

3. Rails server is using https:// so at first use we need to go to https://localhost:3002 and accept the server as a trsuted one, and continue to the website. This will allow the data to get send through the Online Car Insurance Interface to the Rails underwriter.
2. Open the browser and access the index.html page from the Website folder. 
If using Chrome the "file://" url doesn't support cookies so I recommend uploading the website on a server or using Mozilla Firefox 

3. Go through the fields and after you press the button a new page will appear.

4. To retrieve a quote you will need to go to the Retrieve menu and provide the email previously used and the identifier that came with it.
